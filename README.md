# Zero-shot Object Detection for PDF 
This demo detects objects within a PDF using a zero-shot object detection model from Hugging Face. It downloads an IKEA manual, converts pages to images, and processes them with the OWLv2 model. Detected objects are highlighted visually, demonstrating efficient identification of key components in instructional documents.
